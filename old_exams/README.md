# Old exams

This folder was created for studying for the 16th of December 2024 ALDES exam.

## NP-hard

You can find an overview of NP-hard problems [here](./np_hard.md) (thanks to [Guldborg](https://github.com/a-guldborg) for creating the document).
Though note that **knapsack** is not a normal NP-hard problem, but can become NP-hard if the integers become insanely large (as it then takes time for basic arithmetic operations and fills up the memory).

## Exam sets

1. [2013 exam set](./2013.md)
  This was my first exam set, and I did not do it well.
  Please do not look at that for inspiration.
2. [2023 march exam set](./2023_mar.md)
  This was my second exam set, and it should be way better (as I have also gone to TA walkthroughs about it).
3. [2023 january exam set](./2023_jan.md)
  This was my third exam set, and it should be fine.
  None of it has been validated but I feel like it should be fine.
