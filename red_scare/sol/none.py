"""
Discussed solution:
Use BFS (or another shortest path algorithm) to find a path without any red nodes.
Potentially you can remove the red nodes from the graph before solving,
but it may become problematic if we want to give the program a finished graph object.

Return:
Length of the shortest path without any red nodes.
